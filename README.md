# Getting Started With Serverless
Amazon Web Services(AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

AWS Lambdas is a product that allows us to write and run code without provisioning or managing servers.
With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

Through these small projects we plan to develop a firm understanding of AWS lambdas and how to harness its power to couple different services together and build event driven pipelines.   

### Our Learning goals:
Through these projects we tend to cover the following topics:
- Writing basic lambda functions.
- Managing permissions using IAM roles and policies.
- Linking different services(S3, SQS,SNS, DynamoDB etc) via lambdas.
- Building lambda deployment package.
- Building lambda step functions.
- Building CI/CD pipleines for AWS lambdas.

### Pre-requisites
All you need is an AWS account and basic Knowledge of any coding language that lambda supports.
